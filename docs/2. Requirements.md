    Summarise these using the use-case template below.



| TODO: USE-CASE ID e.g. UC1, UC2, ... | TODO: USE-CASE NAME | 
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Description** | TODO: Goal to be achieved by use case and sources for requirement |
| **Actors** | TODO: List of actors involved in use case |
| **Assumptions** | TODO: Pre/post-conditions if any</td></tr>
| **Steps** | TODO: Interactions between actors and system necessary to achieve goal |
