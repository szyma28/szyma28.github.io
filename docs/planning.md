# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
TODO: Replace the example text like this with text that describes your project. What is the problem to be addressed?

Imagine you're out and about outside doing whatever you are doing be it shopping or running errands, when suddenly, you hear a rumble coming from the deepest depths of your insides. You need to use the toilet. A lot of businesses don't have customer toilets or are hiding them behind a paywall. Well worry no more, with our app you can find the nearest available public toilet.

### Business benefits
TODO: List high-level benefits that this product will provide.

Chance to find usable public toilets using this one single app, with the ability to not show any that are usable only after you pay, saving money of our users is at the forefront of our mindset. The website will display information about the toilets like opening times, accessibility informations, gender or if they're unisex and a lot more that will save the time of our customers who need this kind of information.

### Options Considered
TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?

First quick google comes up with a Google Play link to a "Toilet Finder" app by BeTommorow. The android app will lead you by a map to a nearest toilet. It's database of toilets is maintained by the apps own community that add new new toilets and remove any that close.

### Expected Risks
TODO: What are the main risks of this project?

The app does not update on time if some changes are made with a public toilet or public toilet is removed for some reason. For example if a public toilet is removed from it's original location or relocated and the app us not updated, it could lead the customer to a wrong destination.

## Project Scope
TODO: Scope of the System of Interest. Include a bullet list of things from your context diagram that are in scope.
