## User Needs

### User stories
TODO: Write brief user stories to explain how various actors would interact with the system to accomplish a goal.
    Express these in the form from agile development:- As a (role) I want (goal) so that (benefit).

As a human with needs, I want to find a toilet near me so that i can relieve myself.
As someone who forgot their wallet at home, I want to find a free public toilet near me so that i can use it without the need to pay for it.

### Actors
TODO: List and describe the actors/users for this product.

### Use Cases
TODO: Describe each use case (at least one per team member).
    Give each use case a unique ID, e.g. UC1, UC2, ...
    Summarise these using the use-case template below.
